# sysprep

This repo contains files that allow you to use sysprep to generalize an Windows imagem while setting a password to the administrator account and supressing the OOBE phase. In conjunction with cloudbase init, with Openstack, for example, it`s possible to provide a different administrator password to the image during the deploy.
